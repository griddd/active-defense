Nmap has a script ssl-cert-intaddr which looks for any internal IP addresses in a certificate.  Would it be worthwhile to plant a false

What about throwing a few hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) in the HTML source of a webpage?  Throw off an attacker by getting him sidetracked
on hash cracking.  For example, "admin hash 7ec4026cf519fc67734911926453e816a3801fcd02d571bf452981457d5f81d9"

Fake metadata in PDFs, or other downloadable files?

Use BurpSuite against itself.  For example, the Intruder option Grep-Match looks for certain strings within HTTP responses.  Take those
strings and return a random one in a hidden field...like so "Illegal operation when running stored procedure".
