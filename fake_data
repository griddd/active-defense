Nmap has a script ssl-cert-intaddr which looks for any internal IP addresses in a certificate.  Would it be worthwhile to plant a false
internal IP when creating your cert?

What about throwing a few hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) in the HTML source of a webpage?  Throw off an attacker by getting him sidetracked
on hash cracking.  For example, "admin hash 7ec4026cf519fc67734911926453e816a3801fcd02d571bf452981457d5f81d9"  Maybe a hash of some
obvious word (admin, administrator), and a hash of something less obvious (superSA)?

Fake metadata in PDFs, or other downloadable files?  Perhaps putting a fake name as a PDF author, and setup an email account for said 
fake name.  If the account is never used to send mail, receiving email there could be an early attack attempt.

Use BurpSuite against itself.  For example, the Intruder option Grep-Match looks for certain strings within HTTP responses.  Take those
strings and return a random one in a hidden field...like so "Illegal operation when running stored procedure".  This wouldn't interfere
with normal user behavior.
