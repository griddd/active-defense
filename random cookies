Since I deal mostly with .NET, been exploring the idea of using the random class to generate strings of varying sizes.  These could be used
in hidden fields within an aspx page, to mislead attackers.  This would also stifle fuzzing attempts.  As an attacker, if I have widely 
varying HTTP response sizes, how do I know which payload caused the result?  Could I fuzz accurately?
