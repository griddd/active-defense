What if I included a deliberately vulnerable component in my code, but didn't use it?  Perhaps an older version of jQuery?  I want 
something that will trigger a scanner alert.  Anything in Retire.js would do.  As an attacker, this would certainly get my attention!  
Must take care doing this, so as not to get hacked.

In a similar vein, if you've got a ASP.NET MVC application, then you'll probably see the HTTP response header "X-AspNetMvc-Version".
Lower the version to 2.0
